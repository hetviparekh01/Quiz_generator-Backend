Test: Dynamic Quiz Generation. About 5 to 7H
 
Expected:
  - Questions CRUD with difficulty. (only admin can add questions)
  - Dynamic Questions paper generation for user based on all previous test result(s) and difficulty. (IMP)
  - Old exam review
  - APIs should be protected
 
Ex:
  - When the user is giving exam first time the question will have lower difficulty.
  - but next time base on the score and ratio of questions difficulty generate next exam for instance if the last exam have 100% question of easy difficulty and got 70% score increase difficulty of 70% of the questions
  - difficulty rating will be from 1 - 10 for each question.
 
NOTE: DIFFICULTY WILL NOT BE BASED ON JUST LAST EXAM BUT ALL PREVIOUS EXAMS
